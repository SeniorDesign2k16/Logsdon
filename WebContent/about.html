<h2>About The Gene-Spot</h2>
<p>
	The Gene-Spot is an application designed to cluster related genes among
	organisms across evolutionary time and provide biological researchers
	with relevant information for local analysis/annotation. <br>
	<br /> Currently, annotating the vast amounts of genetic information
	contained in public & private databases can takes months to complete
	and must be accomplished manually. Additionally, there is no current
	standard for displaying this kind of information (further complicating
	annotation) and are no reliable methods of data verification, making it
	difficult to transfer results from lab to lab. The Gene-Spot automates
	parts of this process, vastly increasing the speed at which data can be
	acquired and analyzed. Pertinent information is then organized and
	stored in a new database, ready to update and/or distribute. <br>
